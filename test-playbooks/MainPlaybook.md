# This is the main test playbook


## Streaming Support

This section tests changes due to streaming

### Case: Streaming new features and old versions

1. Open a new surge, open a SINE oscillator. FM mode should be compatible
2. Make oscillator 2 an FM2; is Oscillator 1 still in compatible mode?
3. Load the patch "Argoblith/Blue Pad" and make sure the SINE oscillators are
   in legacy mode
4. Load the patch (TEST PATCH NEEDED AT VERSION 11) and make sure the SINE
   oscillators are mix legacy and normal mode
